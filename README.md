Audio Project
This is an Audio Project that I decided to work on to improve my front end coding while diving into the music/sound aspect.
I have a hard downloaded soundtrack that plays on loop within interaction of the page allowing the sound to play instantaneously. 
I used a method to splice youtube url and use the youtube embed to display the youtube link on the page.
